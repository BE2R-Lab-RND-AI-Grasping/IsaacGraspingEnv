"""Sub-module containing converters for converting various file types to USD.

In order to support direct loading of various file types into Omniverse, we provide a set of
converters that can convert the file into a USD file. The converters are implemented as
sub-classes of the :class:`AssetConverterBase` class.

The following converters are currently supported:

* :class:`UrdfConverter`: Converts a URDF file into a USD file.
* :class:`MeshConverter`: Converts a mesh file into a USD file. This supports OBJ, STL and FBX files.
